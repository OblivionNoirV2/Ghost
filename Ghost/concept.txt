You get a set number of moves, computer will try to mirror it. 
Blockades or other grid elements shift every turn, in a consistent cycle. 
The shifts are always consistent, like 8 different phases. 
Multiple color squares, each with different meanings. 
You can move from anywhere starting at the gridâ€™s edge, special color indicates your pieces. 
The goal is to eliminate the leader of the other side. 
All other pieces become yours when touched. 
Your pieces are each linked to a number, say 1-20, which is how the computer keeps track of the mirroring. Pieces stolen from the other side are not mirrored.
